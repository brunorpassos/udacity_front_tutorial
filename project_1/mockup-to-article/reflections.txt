You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

I`ve learned about some tags that I`ve never heard about, like: <s> , <del> , <sup>.
Also, it was good for learning some good practices and accessibility.
It was easy to understand tree structure and also replicate HTML structure, because it was something I already knew.
But I guess it was hard to replicate the mockup exactly like was asked.
The problem solving strategies was something I used to do on my daily basis, so I kept using those strategies like I used before.
